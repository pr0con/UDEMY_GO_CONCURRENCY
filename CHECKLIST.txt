Concurrency vs. Parallelism:

	Concurrency is a property of the code
	parallelism is a property of the running process

Race Conditions
	1. when concurrent processes need to be synchronized but are not
		- no guarantee that process_one will wait for process_two to finish

Atomicity
	- Atomic means an operation that cannot be divided, into concurrent operations
		- like declaring the value of a variable


Memory Access Synchronization
1. sync.Waitgroup (2)
2. sync.Cond	  (2)
3. sync.Once
4. sync.Mutex
5. sync.RWMutex


Deadlocks
	- concurrent process_one relies on process_two <-- two will never finish
Livelock
